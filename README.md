# Clicker

A simple (and unfinished) JavaScript implementation of the classic Cookie Clicker idle game genre. 


## Features

* human-clickable and self-clicking resource generators (or both, or neither)
* multiple resource types
* separation of game data and engine -- just drop in your own `js/data.js`, `index.html` and `css/stylesheet.css`
* automatic HTML element creation


## Features in dire need of implementing

* saving/loading of game state
* purchasable upgrades to clicker objects
